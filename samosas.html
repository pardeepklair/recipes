    <h4>Recipe:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Saut√© cumin seeds for potato filling</li>
                    <p>     Put a pan on medium flame and add 2 tsp oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, 
                            add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.</p>
            <li>Add spices and boiled potatoes and cook for a while</li>
                <p>Add whole coriander seeds, ginger and green chilligaram masala powder, red chilli powder, 
                   salt to taste. Mix well and saute for 2 minute.</p>
            <li>Prepare the dough for the Samosa</li>
                <p> Take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour with salt. 
                    Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time. 
                    Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. 
                    A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. </p>
            <li>Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half</li>
                <p>Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough.
                   Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin</p>
            <li>Fill the semi-circle with potato filling and deep fry</li>
                <p>Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone. 
                   Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers.
                   Then, heat oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat until golden brown.</p>
